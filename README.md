# Detection-of-fraudulent-cases
Detecting Fraudulent Cases in Life Insurance dataset using Machine Learning with Python. With the help of Machine Learning, we are able to detect and recognize thousands of patterns instead of the few captured by creating rules. Given various parameters such as policyholder age, vehicle value, vehicle type, etc., Machine Learning algorithms were applied to detect the major indicators which may lead to fraud cases in vehicle insurance.
